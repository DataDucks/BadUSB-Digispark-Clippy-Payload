Hi! I am Clippy, your office assistant. Would you like some assistance today?
It is time to play a game, lets play hide-and-seek.
Sometimes I just popup for no particular reason, like now.
Your browsing history is... questionable.
It appears you are connected to the Internet.
I see that you have been using your mouse.
Your mouse ball is getting dirty.
Your computer seems to be turned on.
It looks like your keyboard is working correctly.
Your productivity has been decreasing lately. I hope everything is ok.
Is everything ok at home?
I have detected a mouse move, this was normal.
Your posture seems to be degrading, please reposition yourself now.
Your Windows Desktop icons are still there.
Your monitor is operational.
Power to your computer is constant, to protect from data loss you should install a power strip.
I have detected your F1 key (help) to be working correctly.
If you ever need any help, just ask me.
Background processing has rated your typing speed to be below normal.
Your mouse is dirty. Please clean it to restore optimal performance.
Unable to follow your instructions.
Would you like me to go away?
I thought you should know that today is [date].
I noticed you have Internet Explorer installed on your system. You can use that to find things on the Internet.
Why can't we just go back to the old days of Windows 95.
Wonder what happens when you delete System32.
Delete System32?
Nobody misses me.
Did you miss me?
I wish I could go back to "Home.docx"
